### Files of classifications for the APOGEE data

 - All files start with `3Component_AllFeHCutMembership_Percentiles_reduceSNR_`.
 - There are two sets of unique bins: [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]] and [[0.5,1.5],[1.5,2.5],[2.5,3.5]].
 - The integer bins are labelled as `r{}R{}_cyl.csv`, where the `{}` are replaced by the minimum and maximum radii, respectively.
 - The half-integer bins follow the same nomenclature, except the minimum and maximum radii are multiplied by 10. That is, for the bin that is [1.5,2.5], the filename is `3Component_AllFeHCutMembership_Percentiles_reduceSNR_r15R25_cyl.csv`.
