### Bar+Bulge Mock

This mock file is the bar 'growth phase' snapshot from the cusp halo model of Petersen, Weinberg, Katz (2021)[^1], with a Plummer bulge added to it by hand.

 - To estimate bar membership, I took 10 snapshots on either side of the exact time and used the classification from PWK21 to provide an estimate from 0-20 of whether the orbit is a member of the bar. A reasonable threshold might be 10.
 - Bulge membership is binary, with -1 indicating that the model star was drawn from the bulge model.


[^1]: For internal consumption, this is snapshot 1000 from the run001 simulation.
