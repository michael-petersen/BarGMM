### Bar Mock

This mock file is the bar 'growth phase' snapshot from the cusp halo model of Petersen, Weinberg, Katz (2021)[^1].

 - To estimate bar membership, I took 10 snapshots on either side of the exact time and used the classification from PWK21 to provide an estimate from 0-20 of whether the orbit is a member of the bar. A reasonable threshold might be 10.  
 - The bar was rotated by -12 degrees. This corresponds to an expected alpha fit of 78 degrees. We also expect then to see much larger y velocity dispersions compared to x velocity dispersions.

[^1]: For internal consumption, this is snapshot 1000 from the run001 simulation.
