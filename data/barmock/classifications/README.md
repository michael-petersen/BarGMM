For different bins, the mean radii and star numbers are given below.
 - The mean uncertainties for angular momentum are currently too small given the data results
 - The sample size is twice that of the data, as we include both an in-APOGEE-footprint and out-of-APOGEE-footprint sample.
 - However, the shape of the distance distribution does not exactly match that of the data.
